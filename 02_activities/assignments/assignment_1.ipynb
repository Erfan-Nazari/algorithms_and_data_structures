Then, we call a helper fuction called traverse with arguments root, paths and current_path. The traverse function will add the current node value to the current_path list and call itself to traverse left and right paths if they exist. If the current node is a leaf (i.e. there is no left and no right children), we add a copy of the current path (which is the path from the root to this leaf) to the paths list. Finally, we remove the current node from the current_path list as we are going back to the parent of this node.

    "> Answer: Let \"n\" be the number of nodes, \"d\" be the maximum depth, and \"l\" be the number of leaves in the given tree. Our output (i.e. paths) is a list of \"l\" lists of maximum size \"d\" each. Because for each leaf, we have a path with maximum length equals to the depth \"d\". So, our output is a list of lists containing maximum \"l*d\" integers. To add each of these integers to our output, we need at least one operation and one space in our memory to store it. In conclusion, our time and space complexity are both at least O(ld). Below we will check, if they are exactly O(ld) or more. Before that let's find a relationship between \"n\", \"d\", and \"l\". For an approximately balenced binary tree, we have that \"d\" is approximately \"log(n)\" and \"l\" is approximately \"n/2\". So for an approximately balenced binary tree, we have that O(ld) is the same as O(nlog(n)). For the other extreme case when the tree is linear, we have only one leaf and the depth \"d\" is the same as \"n\", and hence, O(ld) is the same as O(n). We conclude that O(ld) is betweeen O(n) and O(nlog(n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Space Complexity: Our call stack and current_path list will both have size of maximum depth of the tree, \"d\", so they are O(d), which is not more that O(ld). So, we conclude that our space complexity is O(ld).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Time Complexity: We visit each \"n\" nodes of the tree once and we do constant O(1) operations for each node like appending to or poping from current_path list except for the leaf nodes that we copy the current_path in our output list, paths. This last operation (done only for \"l\" leaves) is O(len(current_path)) which is O(d) in the worst case. So, we see that our time complexity is O(n + ld). Using the above explanation that O(ld) is betweeen O(n) and O(nlog(n)), we can say that O(ld) is greater or equal than O(n) and hence O(n + ld) = O(ld).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Conclusion: Both of our space and time complexities are O(ld) which is O(nlog(n)) in the worst case scenario and is O(n) in the best case scenario. This also proves that our algorithm is the best time and space complexity solution becasue our output is O(ld) and no algorithm can create this output in less time or sapce than O(ld)."

    "\n",
    "> Alternative Solution: We can add one extra attribute \"self.parent\" to the class TreeNode. This attribute allows us to access the parent node from its children and traverse the tree upward. Then starting from the root node of the tree, we recursively visit the current node's children until we reach leaves (nodes with no children), and we create a list of all leaves of the tree. Then we iterate over this list of all leaves, and we use parent attribute recursively until we reach the root (the unique node with no parent) to create and store the paths from roots to leaves. "
