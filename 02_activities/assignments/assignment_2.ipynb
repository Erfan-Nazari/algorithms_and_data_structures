    "> Answer: The logic of his solution is clear and straightforward. First. he find the maximum number in the input list and call it \"n\". So, we want to find missing integers from the interval [0,n]. He first label all integers in this interval as missing. To do this, he creates a list of size \"n+1\" and calls it \"present\" and intializes it with \"False\" for all n+1 entries. Basically, present[i] is a label mentioning if the number i is present in the input list or not. Then, he checks the entries in the input list one by one and change their correspoding label in the \"present\" list as \"True\". When we traverse the input list once, the label list, \"present\", is updated correctly. Finally, he creates an empty list called \"missing\" and adds every integer \"i\" in the interval [0,n] that its present lable is false (i.e. present[i] == False) to the missing list. Then, he returns this \"missing\" list as the output if it not empty. If it is empty, he returns -1. In summary:\n",

    "> Answer: Let \"m\" be the size of input list and \"n\" be the maximum integer in the input list. Finding the maximum integer in the input list needs time complexity O(m) and space complexity O(1). Creating and initializing the \"present\" list needs both time and space complexity O(n). Updating the \"present\" list by traversing the input list needs oth time complexity O(m) and space complexity O(1). Finally, creating the \"missing\" list as our output needs both time and space complexity O(n) in the worst case scenario. The conclusion is that the time complexity is O(max{m,n}) and the space complexity is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that it is possible that \"m\" is much larger than \"n\" or vice versa. So, we need to keep max{m,n} in the time complexity as it is and we can't replace it with either \"m\" or \"n\". For example, the input can be a list of size one billion but all entries be 1 (in this example, m is one billion, but n is 1). On the other hand, the input can be a list of size 1 containing the integer one billion (in this example, m is 1, but n is one billion)."

    "> My partner's solution is very good. It is clear, straightforward, and the best time and space solution. He also supported his solution with enough comments and explanation, to make it easy to understand. One area of improvement is to be more careful and distinguish between the size of the given input list and the maximum integer in the input list. They are two completely independent numbers and they can be very different from each other (For example, the input can be a list of size one billion but all entries be 1, and hence size is one billion and maximum is 1. On the other hand, the input can be a list of size 1 containing the integer one billion, and hence size is 1 and maximum is one billion.).
